VersionEye is a notification system for software libraries. It notifies you about outdated dependencies in your repository and works currently for Ruby (Bundler), Python (Pypi), Node.JS (NPM), Java (Maven, Gradle), PHP (Composer) and Clojure (Lein). The integration for CocoaPods and Bower is on the way.

This service hook will inform VersionEye every time you push to GitHub. On every push VersionEye will reparse your project file.
